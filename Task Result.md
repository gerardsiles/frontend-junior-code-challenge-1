# Task Result

Hi!
this is what I had time to do. I'm missing the download for the raw csv with the same format, but the data is too long (you can see the output in the console).

With more time I could had fixed that and implement a few more ideas that I had and refactor the components, specially the table component, implementing the global store for the data.

I hope that this is enough for you to see a bit how I code and organise things.

Thanks for spending your time reviewing this code, I had a lot of fun implementing all the UI!
